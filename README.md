Everything in this directory relates to the volunteer work I did with the 2023-24 Mid Michigan College Women's Basketball Team. 

The primary Excel file evolved quite a bit over the course of the season, and I included the previous iterations I have to show it. Also included are a number of Word Docs and PNGs that provide examples of the written analysis that was conducted, as well as graphical analysis.

The course of the project was from Mid-November to March.

To avoid clutter, additional charts and images an be found on my DropBox - https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/s8abse37tog5z55xgjm13/AAS1F-387haZyHb61FwL5H4?rlkey=jtqomxbdcooreo1sesotzagu0&st=6bkiju5n&dl=0
